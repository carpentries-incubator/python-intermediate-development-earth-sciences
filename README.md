# Intermediate Research Software Development Skills In Python for Earth Sciences

This lesson teaches intermediate-level course in research software engineering and development skills and collaborating as part of a
team (using Python as an example language) to Earth scientists using analysis of river catchment data as an example project. It has been
based off the [original lesson on intermediate research software skills in The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-inflammation).

### Target Audience

A typical learner for this course may be someone who has gained basic software development skills either by
self-learning or attending a foundational course such as the novice [Software Carpentry Python course][swc-lessons].
However, their software
development-related projects are now becoming larger and more complex and they need more
intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code,
automate the process of testing and verifying its correctness and support collaborations with others.

### Lesson Status

The lesson is currently in beta - it has been tested extensively with
different cohorts by the lesson authors as well as independently by people not directly involved in the lesson development
and is in a good state to be reused and taught by others.

## Teaching the Lesson

The lesson is suitable for both instructor-led teaching or guided self-learning where instructors provide help
and answer questions (synchronously or asynchrounously) as learners go through the course on their own.
Initially, in sections 1-3 of the lesson,
learners are working on a software project and going though exercises individually.
In sections 4 and 5, they are grouped and work in teams,
as they would when collaborating on a team software project development.

The lesson has 5 sections;
each section can be delivered or worked through in self-learning mode over a half a day to a day,
depending on the pace.
We would recommend setting aside one day per section to make sure the delivery is not rushed.

If you would like to teach this lesson to your audience and help with more beta testing,
please let the lesson developers know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-intermediate-development-earth-sciences/issues/new?assignees=&labels=pilot&template=lesson-pilot-issue-template.md&title=) with your workshop details and a
